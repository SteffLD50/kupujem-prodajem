## About the Project

It's a solo project, and it's still a work in progress.

I am a long-term user of the site [KupujemProdajem](https://novi.kupujemprodajem.com/). Since I'm posting and reposting about 30 ads every month, I decided to make the whole process easier for myself with the help of test automation. While manually posting 30 ads, it took me more than one hour to complete the process. It was a draining and boring process... Now, it's all done in about 15 minutes, and on the plus side, I can just sit and watch while the ads are posted by themself.

The purpose of this project is to learn and gain new experiences without gaining any money. I'm still looking for ways to speed up the whole process. Feel free to reach out to me and give me some feedback.

## How Do Ads Work on KupujemProdajem?

The validity period of a standard ad (without any paid promotion or KP Obnavljaƒç) is 30 days. After 30 days the ad will be automatically deleted. Monthly, 30 ads can be placed for free, everything above that has to be paid.

```

then use this command to install the required dependencies:

```

### 1. Credentials

#### KupujemProdajem credentials:

In the project's root folder `../kupujem-prodajem` find the file `cypress.env.json` and open it.
Enter the valid login credentials inside the quotation marks for the existing account.

#### Facebook credentials:

### 2. Creation of an Ad

Open the file `PostavljanjeOglasa.cy.js` located in the folder `../kupujem-prodajem/cypress/e2e/`. There are already a couple of examples in the file. If we look at the examples we'll notice that every ad is an `it()` block in which we're calling a method. The method is called by typing:

```
postavljanjeOglasaPage.postavljanjeOglasa()
```

The method has 9 parameters:

`postavljanjeOglasa(adType, adCategory, adGroup, adTitle, adPrice, currency, condition, adDescription, imageFiles)`

If there are any ambiguities, analyze the existing examples.

### 3. Ad Posting

After the ads are implemented, Automated Ad Posting can be launched. Enter the following command in the terminal:

```
npm run cypress
```

Cypress will launch in the headed mode (cypress open).

-   Choose "E2E Testing".
-   Check "Electron" browser and click "Start E2E Testing in Electron".
-   Click on "automatedAdPosting.cy.js"

That's it!

If everything was done as described above, the ads should be posted.

### For Linux Users:

When running on Linux OS, minor changes are required in the file `package.json` for test runner commands to work. Find the object `"scripts"` and inside of it replace every `\\` with `/`. After the changes are done, the object `"scripts"` should look like this:

```
"scripts": {
        "cypress": "./node_modules/.bin/cypress open",
        "cy-headless": "./node_modules/.bin/cypress run",
        "html-report": "cypress run --spec cypress/e2e/automatedAdPosting.cy.js --browser electron --headed"
    },
```

# Attention

It should be noted that every time the tests are launched, all the implemented ads will be posted. That means there will be duplicate ads if the same tests are repeated. Also, don't forget that the monthly free amount of ads is 30.

## Few Tips

To skip some of the implemented ads instead of deleting them, mark them as a comment. Commenting is done by marking the desired code and pressing `ctrl` + `/`. Press the same buttons to cancel a comment.

Also, if we have implemented several ads in the project, but we only want to post just one specific ad and ignore all the rest, we can do that by adding `".only"` to the desired `"it()"` block, which would look like this: `it.only()`.
